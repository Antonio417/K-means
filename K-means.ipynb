    "As the name suggests, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the training of a model is not supervised using labels of the training dataset. Instead, models themselves attempt to find hidden patterns and insights from the given data. Unsupervised learning cannot be directly applied to a regression or classification problem because unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data (no labels). The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of the dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent the data in a compressed format."

    "K-Means Clustering is one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithms. You will first decide a number *k*, which corresponds to the number of clusters that you desire to have in your dataset. This number will also correspond to the number of centroids. A centroid is the location representing the center of a cluster. Each data point in your dataset is allocated to a specific cluster following a set of rules in an iterative manner. Also, the locations of the centroids are updated subsequently by averaging the data points assigned to the respective cluster. The **‘means’** in the k-Means Clustering refers exactly to this method of updating each cluster centroid."
